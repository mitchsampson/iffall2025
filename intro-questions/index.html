            <strong>Background and motivation for taking this class:</strong>
            <div class="answer">
                I have completed two software engineering internships and one computer science internship, giving me close to a year of professional experience working with HTML/CSS/JS and similar technologies like Salesforce. I'm taking this class because I want to expand my skills beyond the technical aspects of web development and learn more about artistic design principles.

            <div class="answer">
                I hope to learn more about artistic design principles and visual aesthetics so I can make my own websites more personalized.

        <li>
            <strong>How designing for screen differs from designing for paper:</strong>
            <div class="answer">
                Screen designs must be responsive to different device sizes and orientations, while paper has fixed dimensions. Additionally, screen designs must consider factors like loading times and accessibility for users with disabilities.

        <li>
            <strong>Website that exemplifies effective design:</strong>
            <div class="answer">
                <a href="https://www.apple.com" target="_blank">Apple's website</a> is just chef's kiss when it comes to design. Everything feels clean and intentional.

        <li>
            <strong>Website that exemplifies effective communication:</strong>

                <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> exemplifies effective communication, and it's free (10/10 accessibility).

        <li>
            <strong>Website that works well:</strong>
            <div class="answer">
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon</a> gets stuff done at an extraordinary scale and gives users a fast experience they can't get anywhere else. I like their integration with Whole Foods for returning products as well.
